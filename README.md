# TDM 101 – The Data Mine I Projects

This repository contains my project work from **TDM 101 – The Data Mine I**, an introductory data science seminar focused on hands-on data analysis, computational tools, and effective communication of insights using real-world datasets.

The projects emphasize applied learning, systematic problem-solving, and data-driven reasoning across a variety of data types and scales.

## Core Data Science Concepts Covered

Across the TDM 101 projects, I worked on the following core concepts:

- **Foundations of Data Science**
  - Framing real-world problems as data-driven questions
  - Selecting appropriate data science strategies and tools
  - Understanding the difference between research computing and personal computing environments

- **Working with Big Datasets**
  - Analyzing large, real-world datasets that cannot be handled trivially
  - Efficiently exploring and summarizing high-volume data
  - Reasoning about performance and scalability in data analysis workflows

- **Data Acquisition & Exploration**
  - Working with structured datasets from credible and diverse sources
  - Understanding variables, data context, and data dictionaries
  - Identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies during initial exploration

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
  - Handling missing, inconsistent, and noisy data
  - Standardizing and transforming data for downstream analysis
  - Validating data quality before drawing conclusions

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Using descriptive statistics to summarize data
  - Investigating relationships and correlations
  - Drawing insights from numerical, categorical, and temporal data

- **Time Series Analysis**
  - Working with time-indexed data
  - Analyzing trends, seasonality, and temporal patterns
  - Interpreting changes in data over time using visual and statistical methods

- **Data Visualization**
  - Creating clear and interpretable visualizations
  - Using plots to support analytical reasoning
  - Communicating insights effectively through visual and written explanations

- **Information Literacy & Research Skills**
  - Locating and interpreting technical documentation
  - Evaluating the credibility of datasets and data sources
  - Properly citing external references and following ethical data practices
